## Description 
Journaling had countless benefits alongside with what Art can bring out of you, the idea of this app was born.
 Using the great benefits of journaling 
[here is a link if you want to know more](https://journey.cloud/journaling-benefits/)to write down what a specific image or piece of art will bring out of you and with the combination of art and journaling the goal is that you well feel better after using the app by being mindful and present in the moment and being able to express your feelings for a while at least, will have great impact on your mental health.

## Technologies Used
ReactJS was use to bild this app, using multiple components, JSX, and getting data via API requests. Used CSS for styling with multiple approaches, React Router was used for navigation through out the app, Github was used for vergion control.


## Getting Started
the app is easy to use to basically anyone, and it is self explanatory. you click on the image that you lick and a new screen will show, showing the image that you have chosen and a text area for you to journal. once you are done just hit the 'home' link in the top and it will take you back to the home page.
